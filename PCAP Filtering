Wireshark only has a few that you will need to be familiar with:

and          - operator:   and / &&
or           - operator:   or / ||
equals       - operator:   eq / ==
not equal    - operator:   ne / !=
greater than - operator:   gt /  >
less than    - operator:   lt / <

Wireshark also has operators: contains, 
                              matches,
                              bitwise_and operators
Basic Filtering
The basic syntax of Wireshark filters is some kind of service or "protocol" like ip or tcp, followed by a "dot" then whatever is being filtered for 
example an address, MAC, SRC, protocol, etc.

Filtering by IP: 
                            Syntax: ip.addr == <IP Address>

Filtering by SRC and DST: 
                            Syntax: ip.src == <SRC IP Address> and ip.dst == <DST IP Address> 


Filtering by TCP Protocols:
Wireshark can filter by both port numbers as well as protocol names.
                            
                            Syntax: tcp.port eq <Port #> or <Protocol Name>


Filtering by UDP Protocols: You can also filter by UDP ports by changing the prefix from tcp to udp

                            Syntax: udp.port eq <Port #> or <Protocol Name>
