Wireshark only has a few that you will need to be familiar with:

and          - operator:   and / &&
or           - operator:   or / ||
equals       - operator:   eq / ==
not equal    - operator:   ne / !=
greater than - operator:   gt /  >
less than    - operator:   lt / <

Wireshark also has operators: contains, 
                              matches,
                              bitwise_and operators
Basic Filtering
----------------
The basic syntax of Wireshark filters is some kind of service or "protocol" like ip or tcp, followed by a "dot" then whatever is being filtered for 
example an address, MAC, SRC, protocol, etc.

ip.addr == <IP Address>
Syntax: ip.src == <SRC IP Address> 
ip.dst == <DST IP Address> 
tcp.port eq <Port #> or <Protocol Name>
udp.port eq <Port #> or <Protocol Name>
http.request.method == POST
